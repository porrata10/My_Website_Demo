    <p>Since I was in highschool I've always had an interest in computers. How they worked what are the core parts that make them what they are. When I started taking concentration classes for my computer science degree it was about programming fundamentals.
      Basic input, output operations, arithmetics and different topics such as conditions and loops. Also how was the logic in writing the code and that given a task you could solve it in multiple ways.
    </p>
    <p>As I got deeper in to concentration classes I started exploring object oriented programming wich opened a lot of doors in the form of how I tackled a problem and how my thinking process was.
    </p>
    <p>I like working in a team because everybody complements each other in a way that makes the process of building a project more simpler and easier to create.
    </p>
    <p> <br>Im a good problem solver, most of the programming problems that ocurred to me I can solve them or look for help and use it as a learning process. If some day I have the same problem I would know immediatly how to solve it.
    </p>
    <p>I have previously worked in the mobile development area using Swift to develop iOS apps. I helped to Develop GuardDV wich is a security application that allows for automated enforcement of protection orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I was in an internship with TrueNorth Corporation, a consultant and software development agency. My experience was working with the C# programming language and the .NET framework to develop a windows form application to manage inventory of business
      equipment.
