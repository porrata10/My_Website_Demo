</p>

<ul class="content">
<li><strong>Videogames.</strong> Ever since I was a kid I've been a gamer I remember getting my first console wich was a Nintendo 64 and since now recently I have the Nintendo Switch. I like most types of games I go from role-playing games like Skyrim and The Witcher to indie games like Stardew Valley and Owl Boy.</li>
<li><strong>New Technology.</strong> The capabilities of a machine always finds a way to amazes me. Telephones have changed quite a bit since the first portable cellular phone the DynaTAC from Motorola to the most recent smartphone the Samsung Note 9. Other new technologies are Dot wich is the first braille smartwatch for the blind, Talkitt is an application that helps users with speech and language disorders to commmunicate with other people and UNI wich is a two-way communication tool for the deaf using gesture and speech technology </li>
<li><strong>Exploring and Traveling.</strong> Im from Puerto Rico and going around the island and exploring beaches or new places is really satisfying because you get to have new experiences around them.The beaches here are like none other and the hospitality of the people, the music and the food is what I really adore about my island. I've traveled not to many places but the ones that let a mark on me are England, France and Netherlands. Europe is so different from Puerto Rico in the style of cooking, architecture, people, etc. One of my dreams is to travel to Asia and visit Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and much more countries.</li>
<li><strong>Soccer.</strong> It is the most popular sport in the world and it has been a part of me since I was in 5th grade. Soccer has always been there for me when I was mad or sad I use to take a ball and maneuver it around my house or go to the park and practice kicks and passes. I follow the english, spanish and italian leagues because there style of playing soccer is very different, the italian is very defensive, the spanish is very attacking and aggressive and the english is more technical wich is my favorite one.</li>
